# EVENT_TICKETING_SYSTEM_
This project contains an SQL script that demonstrates the creation and management of a simple Company Database using MySQL.
The database is designed to store and manipulate employee information, including their ID, name, salary, and department.

The script covers key SQL concepts such as:

Database and Table Creation – Creating a new database (companyy) and an employee table.

Data Manipulation (DML) – Inserting, updating, and deleting employee records.

Table Alteration – Adding and removing columns dynamically using ALTER TABLE.

Transaction Control – Demonstrating COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT for managing changes safely.

Aggregate Functions – Using MAX, MIN, AVG, COUNT, and SUM to analyze salary data.

Sorting and Limiting Results – Retrieving specific records like the second-highest salary.

Conditional Updates – Assigning departments using the CASE statement.

By the end of this script, you’ll have a working understanding of:
✅ How to create and modify databases and tables
✅ How to use transactions and savepoints effectively
✅ How to perform calculations and filtering using SQL queries

This project serves as a complete SQL learning exercise, combining basic CRUD operations, schema modification, and transaction management in one cohesive example.
